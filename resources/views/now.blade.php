                <h3>
                    What is a “now page”?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most websites have a link that says “about”. It goes to a page that tells you something about the
                    background of this person or business. For short, people just call it an “about page”.</p>
                <p>
                    Most websites have a link that says “contact”. It goes to a page that tells you how to contact this
                    person or business. For short, people just call it a “contact page”.</p>

                <p>
                    So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused
                    on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.</p>
                
                <p>
                    See examples by browsing <a href="https://nownownow.com" target="_blank" title="Visit the origin of /Now page.">nownownow.com</a>.</p>

                <p>
                    Although it’s normal to make the web address “/now”, just like it’s usually “/about” and “/contact”
                    in those other examples, the URL could be anything.</p>
